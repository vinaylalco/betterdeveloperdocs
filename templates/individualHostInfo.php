	<p>Bluehost is one of the favored hosts as per <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wordpress.org/hosting/">wordpress.org</a> (the creators of WordPress software) and has been around as a hosting company for many years.</p>

	<p>You can read their Trust Pilot (independent review platform) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.bluehost.com">here</a> but overall they get 4.0 / 5 stars at time of writing (December 2022). It is worrying that they have 30% 1 star reviews so do read those in case you find something there which alarms you before purchasing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Costs over time:</h2>
<p>Hosting Plans will often be charged at one rate for the initial contract but a higher rate in order to renew the contract. As such it's nice to know the cost beyond the initial contract.</p>
<p>Initial period 36 months</p>
<p>Initial monthly rate @ 36 month contract: $49.95</p>
<p>Initial cost of 36 months: $1,798.20.</p>
<p>Cost of next 36 months: $2,159.64 so it goes up by 20% p/year</p>
